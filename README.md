# Netflix Clone

This is a Netflix clone built using React, designed to replicate the look and feel of the popular streaming platform. The app fetches movie and TV show data using the **TMDB API** and displays various categories of films with interactive features.

## Features
- **Dynamic Movie Lists**: Movies and TV shows are fetched from the TMDB API and categorized by genres.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects and clickable posters enhance user interaction.
- **Video Playback**: Clicking on a movie poster displays the trailer (YouTube integration).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **TMDB API**: To fetch movie and TV show data.
- **YouTube Integration**: For playing movie trailers.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your TMDB API key in a `.env` file or directly in the project configuration.
4. Run the app using `npm start`.

This project was created as a learning exercise to explore React development and API integration while mimicking the Netflix UI.
